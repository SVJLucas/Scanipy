**Scanipy** stands for "scan it with Python"â€”it's your smart Python library for **scanning and parsing complex PDF files** like books, reports, articles, and academic papers. Utilizing cutting-edge **Deep Learning** algorithms, Scanipy transforms your PDFs into a treasure trove of extractable information: **tables, images, equations, and text**. Say goodbye to manual scanning tasks and hello to automated, intelligent data extraction.

## Example

ðŸš¨ **The code is still under development, but it should be fully functional by September 29, 2023.** ðŸš¨

Run with

```python
import scanipy

parser = scanipy.Parser()
document = parser.extract("test.pdf")
document.to_markdown(output_folder="output")
```

Visualize the extracted blocks with

```python
document.visualize_pipeline(page=0, step=0)
```
