    Analyze the structure of tables in images using a fine-tuned Table Transformer model.

    The model is based on the Table Transformer (DETR) by Microsoft, trained on PubTables1M.
    It can detect structural elements like rows and columns within tables in images.

    Source: https://github.com/microsoft/table-transformer

    Attributes:
        model (object): The loaded fine-tuned Table Transformer model.

    Example:
        >>> analyzer = TableStructureAnalyzer()
        >>> result = analyzer(image)
